## Description:

Build a package in Python that where user will input a company's financial statements and get back forecasts and DCF valuation with visual insights of the company's future performance.

## Major milestones:

1. User needs to provide the data for 2 financial statements-- `Income` and `Balance Sheet`, preferably in the source format inside the data folder.
2. Compute the remaining components of the financial statements
3. Forecast 5-year ahead values based on commonly used strategies
4. Report each statement with actuals and forecats in a concise manner
5. Build and report a DCF valuation model
6. Provide visualisations to understand the financial performance of the company and what to expect in 5 years

## Limitations:

1. Depends on Excel/manual inputting from user
2. Specific to a single methodology

## Vision:

Connect this package to an API that will help to fetch data-points directly without involving Excel and allow for diverse forecasting and reporting techniques going forward.
